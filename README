Title: "Disease in the Inland Empire" (Congressional App Contest Submission, 10/10/22-10/31/22)
This is a collaborative submission for the 2022 Congressional App Contest.  Alongside my classmates, Makayla Williams (Makayla-Williams53) and Alexa Torres (AlexaGTorres), I helped build an app that aims to inform Inland Empire residents of disease statistics in their area.  We based this project on one of my previous projects that focused on providing remedies for those infected with COVID-19.  This app uses pie charts and bar graphs to showcase illness rates in our area and aims to encourage safe/disease-combative behaviors.  We did not have specific requirements for this assignment, but we receieved guidance for the graph portion of this project through in-class lessons.
